Release Note for the version2.0 

Date of release : 01/09/2006

	
Changes from version 1 to 2:
		
	General
		-Migration from Geant4.7.1 to Geant4.8.1
		
	Detection
		-Capability to detect the energy deposited in the soil vs depth 
		------------------------------------------------------
			This can be done by creating a soil energy deposited in a
			1D histogram with the cmd
				
			/PLANETOCOS/ANALYSIS/EDEP/SoilEdepVsDepthInGPerCm2Histo	
			/PLANETOCOS/ANALYSIS/EDEP/SoilEdepVsDepthInKmHisto
				
			In the histograms trees these new histograms appears on the directory
			/SOIL_EDEP/ 
		
		-Renaming of the command /PLANETOCOS/ANALYSIS/EDEP/EdepVsDepth	and /PLANETOCOS/ANALYSIS/EDEP/EdepVsAltitude
		------------------------------------------------------	
			To create histograms of energy deposited vs atmospheric depth the commands are now:
			/PLANETOCOS/ANALYSIS/EDEP/AtmoEdepVsDepth
			/PLANETOCOS/ANALYSIS/EDEP/AtmoEdepVsAltitude
			
		
		-Capability to detect the particle flux in the soil.
		----------------------------------------------------------------
			When creating a soil layer by using the cmd  
				
			/PLANETOCOS/SOIL/AddMonoElementLayer  
			/PLANETOCOS/SOIL/AddLayer 
				
			the user can specify to divide the soil layer to be created in a 
			given number of sub layers of equal thickness and same composition. 
			This nb of sub  layers is defined by the last parameter in the cmds
			AddMonoElementLayer and  AddLayer. If omitted the soil layer is not 
			divided into sublayers.
				
			The cmd
				
			/PLANETOCOS/GEOMETRY/SetDetectionBelowSoilLayers true
				
			allows to detect the flux of secondary particles below each soil
			sub layers. By using this cmd a nb of detectors equal to the nb of  
			sub layers is added to the list of other detectors.
				
	Physics
		-Other hadronic physics models available in G4 for nucleon-nuclei, Pion-nuclei
		and  Kaon-nuclei have been added.
		---------------------------------------------
				
			-For the high energy models the following models are now
			available QGSC, QGSP, FTFC, FTFP and LHEP
				 
				
			-For the cascade regime the following models are available:
				 BIC (Binary cascade), BERT (Bertini cascade), LEP (no
				 cascade model)
				
			-For the interactions of neutron of energy <20 MeV the Neutron HP
			model is still available
				   	     		 
			-The models available are now:
				LHEP, LHEP_HP,LHEP_BIC,LHEP_BIC,LHEP_BIC_HP
				QGSP, QGSP_HP,QGSP_BIC,QGSP_BIC,QGSP_BIC_HP
				QGSC, QSC_HP,QGSC_BIC,QGSC_BIC,QGSC_BIC_HP
				FTFP, FTFP_HP,FTFP_BIC,FTFP_BIC,FTFP_BIC_HP
				FTFC, FTFC_HP,FTFC_BIC,FTFC_BIC,FTFC_BIC_HP
				
			-The default model is QGSP_BIC_HP as before	
			
		-Elastic physics 
		-------------------------------------------
			-use of the Elastic physics constructor G4HadronElasticPhysics 
			-According to G4 gadronic team by using this physics
			constructor the elastic scattering on Hydrogen should be better treated 
				
				
		
		
	Propagation in magnetic field:
		
		-Initialisation command for magnetic shielding study
		-----------------------------
		A new initialisation command 
				
			/PLANETOCOS/InitialiseForMagneticShieldingStudy
			
		is provided. In this mode  the Atmosphere and the soil are removed, and the EM and Hadronic
		interactions are switch off.
		
		-Automatic detection of the penumbra for the Earth
		-----------------------------
		For computing a cutoff rigidity grid for the Earth case, instead of using a vector of rigidities defined by the user,
		the penumbra can be detected automatically by using the command
		 
		 /PLANETOCOS/MAGNETIC/AutomaticDetectionOfPenumbra true
		 
		 This allowed to speed up considerably the computing time as less particle trajectories have to be trace to compute the
		 different cutoffs. 
		
		
		
			 
			
		
		
		
	Correction of Bugs:
		
		-The generation of GCR proton spectra was not working correctly for all
		simulation conditions (planet, geometry, physics). The reason of this bug
		was an initialisation problem in the G4SPSEnergyDistribution class. The gps
		developer has been informed about this bug. This bug has been removed in
			PLANETOCOSMICS.
			
		-A bug was  detected by D. Grandi when computing reverse CR trajectory in the Earth
		magnetosphere. The problem was that some trajectories were blocked in the 
		soil resulting in a huge computing time.
			 
		To avoid the occurrence of this bug when computing only the propagation
		of CR in the magnetic field we have defined the command 
				
			/PLANETOCOS/InitialiseForMagneticShieldingStudy
			
		that remove the Atmosphere and the soil, and switch off the EM and Hadronic
		interactions.
		It is still possible to combine the soil, the atmosphere and the magnetic
		field as before.  
		
	
	Examples:
		-The mars_example2.g4mac file has been modified to add the
		computation of the energy deposited and the flux of secondaries in the
		Martian soil. 
	
	
	
	Limitation of the code:
			
		-When using a material (atmosphere or soil) with an important Hydrogen content, the simulation slows down
		significantly. This is most probably due to the efficient thermalization of neutron on the Hydrogen. Thermal neutrons
		do scatter quite a lot of time before being capture. 
		We still need some investigation to find a way to avoid this problem. 
			 
		-Light ion (<C12) physics in Geant4 is treated by the Light ion binary cascade model till an upper energy limit of 
		~10 GeV. Above this energy the treatment of ion is still limited , and scaling of the results obtained with proton is needed.
