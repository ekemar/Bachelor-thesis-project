This is the README file for the PLANETOCOSMICS code written by L.Desorgher 25/05/2005 and adapted by P. von Doetinchem 7/04/2010

-Dependence
------------
	-The Geant4 toolkit should be installed (http://wwwasd.web.cern.ch/wwwasd/geant4/geant4.html)
	-For using all hadronic and electromagnetic physic models available in PLANETOCOSMICS
	 you need to install the Geant4 data files for the following specific (optional) physics processes:
	 		-Low energy NeutronHP model
			-Low energy electromagnetic processes
			-Photon evaporation
			-High-energy elastic scattering processes
	 	         see http://wwwasd.web.cern.ch/wwwasd/geant4/geant4.html    
	-For building the ROOT version the ROOT analysis package should 
	 be correctly installed.
	-The old PLANETOCOSMICS version had also AIDA functionality. This has not been tested in this modified version

-Compilation and installation
------------------------------
-1)From the same directory type:
	make
-2)In the bash startup file (probably .bashrc or .tcshrc) you should add:
	.bashrc:
	export PLANETOCOSMICS=<directory where PLANETOCOSMICS is installed>
	source ${PLANETOCOSMICS}/setupPLANETOCOSMICS.csh
	.tcshrc:
	setenv PLANETOCOSMICS <directory where PLANETOCOSMICS is installed>
	source ${PLANETOCOSMICS}/setupPLANETOCOSMICS.csh
   
-Use of the code
------------------

	PlanetoCosmics <planet_name macro_file>.
	The planet name should be one of  the following candidates : Earth, Mars, Mercury. 
 	If the parameter  macro_file is not provided the code is used in 
	 interactive mode.
   
-Examples
----------
Some examples are contained in the directory examples.
		 
-Documentation
--------------
The document  ./doc/planetocosmics_sum.pdf represents 
the user guide of the code. 
HTML documentation will be generate with doxygen using dot: ./doc/html
